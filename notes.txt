Counts and signature reports-style data

<KaiRo> adrian: BTW, do we have an API to only get the count of a search?
<adrian> KaiRo: you can add &_results_number=0 to your SuperSearch API URL and look at the "total" key in the results
<KaiRo> adrian: and to get the stuff you use in the signature report, e.g. things like installation count?
<KaiRo> adrian: I'll try that one,t hanks
<adrian> I really need to finish writing the Super Search documentation :)
<adrian> one sec, KaiRo 
<adrian> KaiRo: https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/api/SuperSearch/?_results_number=0&_aggs.product.version=_cardinality.install_time
<KaiRo> adrian: sounds great - and yes, docs would be even better than asking you :)
<adrian> KaiRo: in the results, "cardinality_install_time" is the number of distinct install times, so close to the number of installations
